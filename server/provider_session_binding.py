"""Provider-neutral session attachment at the WorkItem boundary.

Provider adapters may return an opaque :class:`ProviderSessionHandle`, but an
intake caller never owns the authority to attach it.  The durable predecessor,
the selected Provider, and the Provider's declared resume capability must all
agree before the handle can leave the ledger and enter a new run request.

Keeping this rule pure and independent from ``WorkLedgerCoordinator`` makes
the ownership boundary reviewable without creating a second source of truth.
