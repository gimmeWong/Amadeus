Before the Host can launch the requested local interactive app, this Provider

the task refers to an existing app, integrate it in place and preserve its
mechanics. If the task creates the app in this same run, build it once with the
integration included. Never create a second app merely to add AUIP.

Read and follow this host-staged skill before editing: {skill_path}
Use the compact interface reference named by that skill. Treat SDK, parser,
validator, and sync-tool implementations as opaque dependencies: do not read
their source unless an observed interface failure cannot be resolved from the
compact reference.
Before finishing, execute this opaque manifest preflight with Python against
the completed staged `auip.manifest.json`: {validator_path}
Then execute this opaque sync preflight with Python against that manifest and
the staged HTML entry: {sync_path}
Do not open or inspect either implementation. Successful preflights are
necessary but not authoritative; the Host reruns final bundle validation.
Use the official SDK named by that skill, keep the app fully usable without
Amadeus, create a valid AUIP manifest, and run the validation required by the
skill. Execute a bounded author-owned boot test of the completed entry both
without AUIP and with the exact materialized runtime scripts; a Web-binding
capture stub is not sufficient because construction validates the first
snapshot synchronously. Do not launch the user-facing app for interaction,
watch it, or operate it during this Provider run; the Host owns product launch
and will do so only after this prerequisite succeeds.
For a participant stance, cover a coherent useful part of the application's
primary interactive loop. Menu and lifecycle controls alone are insufficient
when core play still needs continuous human input; use a feasible app-local
Reactive Controller or remain spectator-only, as the staged interface requires.
For every multi-phase choice family, publish one stable complete `actionTypes`
set in `choice/v1`; a missing current option must remain unavailable rather than
falling out of the legality whitelist.
