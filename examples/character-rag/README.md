# Kurisu starter knowledge

This optional corpus covers 26 topics in separate Japanese and Chinese files
(52 short entries): the BBS handle, lab number, research field, birthday, Okabe's
alias, university, personality, nicknames, Mayuri, Daru, food/drink, D-mail,
time leap, the fictional Amadeus system, Maho, the Science paper, chopsticks,
cooking, Kurisu's father, PhoneWave, El Psy Kongroo, Moeka, Ruka, Faris, Suzuha
and the lab building. Member numbers 001–008 are included in their character entries.

It is a small, reviewed starter corpus, not a complete character encyclopedia.
Texts are original short paraphrases. They describe fictional characters and
setting facts; they do not establish the current user's identity, shared memories,
real-world capabilities, or a mandatory response. No dialogue scripts, voice clips,
model weights, or an unreviewed copy of the old local corpus are included.
The [148-entry audit and comparison](../../docs/character_rag_curation.md) records
which legacy facts were reused, corrected or deferred. The two language files
cover corresponding topics; some supporting details differ to keep entries concise.

The two files have corresponding topic order. The directory loader reads JSON
files in sorted filename order; edit the source texts and rebuild the index when
changing data. Keep personal source files under `.amadeus/knowledge/` or another
private directory, separate from the generated index.

The technical concepts are descriptions of the fiction, not claims that the
software can transfer memories or send messages into the past. Ending-specific
deaths, romance-route commitments, and purported verbatim quotations were left
out to avoid mixing incompatible timelines or inventing a shared personal history.
