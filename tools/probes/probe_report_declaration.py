"""How often does a status question actually get declared as a report?

Task lookup answers a status question from the ledger, correctly, every time
it is invoked -- but it is only invoked when the model declares
`intent="report"`. On 2026-08-02 a real run declared it for neither of two
status questions and the character answered from conversational memory
instead: "created properly, red green and blue each on their own line, no
problems", while the ledger recorded partial completeness needing review and
no file had been written at all. Confidently wrong, about work the user cares
about.

Across four testbed runs the declaration held 6 times in 8, with prompt and
code byte-identical between them. Eight samples of two utterances is not a
rate, and the testbed is an expensive way to collect more: the decision is
made in a single chat turn, so it can be measured directly.

Three things could be behind it, and they point at different fixes:

  * **Phrasing.** If elliptical follow-ups ("那个记会议纪要的呢？") fail where
    explicit ones succeed, the gap is in how the contract is worded.
  * **Self-example.** 2026-07-31 established that the model's own previous
    turns outweigh the system prompt -- a history that showed it answering
    without a tag taught it not to emit one. If a prior report declaration in
    history lifts the rate, the first declaration of a conversation is what
    needs protecting.
  * **Depth.** If a long history hurts, the contract is being diluted.

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -X utf8 tools/probes/probe_report_declaration.py [repeats]

Outcomes are three-way, not pass/fail. Emitting no tag is the measured
failure; emitting `intent="execute"` would be far worse, because a question
would start work -- the chat invariant this whole vocabulary exists to hold.
