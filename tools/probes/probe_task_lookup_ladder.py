"""Does the *assembled* ladder work, or only its parts?

`probe_task_lookup.py` measured the pieces against hand-written prompts:
choosing 12/12, answering 9/9. Those numbers belong to the pieces, not to
`server/task_lookup.py`, and the composition changed three things that the
model actually sees:

  * **Identifiers got 4x longer.** The old probe listed `work_a1`; production
    ids are `work_` + 32 hex. This codebase's strongest negative result is
    that the model will not transcribe an identifier (`workspace_ref`, 0/28),
    and a pick is only useful if the id comes back intact. Section B isolates
    exactly this by running the same questions over the same tasks with only
    the id style changed.

  * **Candidate rows are now derived, not written.** `_candidate_line` renders
    `_status_phrase` off real ledger fields ("succeeded, needs review") rather
    than a hand-chosen string.

  * **Facts are now derived too.** `render_task_facts` adds produced files and
    a rationale line the old probe never showed the model, and production
    speaks them through the `base` prompt -- the variant that made "[DELEGA"
    stop leaking into a read-only answer.

A prefilter also sits in front of the pick now, and it is measurably lossy
(3/4 recall on these same questions, 2026-08-02). So section A runs the whole
`resolve()` ladder and reports *where* each question died, not just whether it
lived.

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -X utf8 tools/probes/probe_task_lookup_ladder.py [repeats]

No backend, no Codex, no ledger: a fake coordinator serves the rows, and only
the model is real. Answers are printed, not just scored -- the checks are
substring approximations and the prose is the real evidence.
